# @title Platform Specific Issues

Linux
=====

Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot)
-----------------------------

If the following error occurs even though libc6-dev is installed,

    Do you install glibc-devel(redhat) or libc6-dev(debian)?
    You need /usr/include/sys/types.h to compile ruby-oci8.

You need to use ruby-oci8 2.1.0 or upper. Otherwise, run the following command and re-install ruby-oci8.

    $ sudo ln -s /usr/include/linux/ /usr/include/sys

General Linux
-------------

Use the same bit-width of libraries with ruby. For example, x86\_64
instant client for x86\_64 ruby and 32-bit instant client for 32-bit
ruby. It depends on the ruby but not on the OS. As for full client,
x86\_64 ruby cannot use with 32-bit full client, but 32-bit ruby can
use with 64-bit full client because 32-bit libraries are in
$ORACLE\_HOME/lib32.

To check which type of ruby do you use:

    file `which ruby`

Note: "`" is a back quote.

Mac OS X
========

OS X 10.7+
----------

Use the latest 64-bit instant client. The older 64-bit (10.2.0.4) instant client [doesn't work](https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=2187558). The older 32-bit instant client will work but only with 32-bit ruby or jruby (using JDBC).

Intel Mac (64-bit)
------------------

See [How to setup Ruby and Oracle Instant Client on Snow Leopard](http://blog.rayapps.com/2009/09/06/how-to-setup-ruby-and-oracle-instant-client-on-snow-leopard/).
Note that setting the environment variable RC\_ARCHS=x86\_64 instead of ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86\_64" will work fine also.

Intel Mac (32-bit)
------------------

See [How to setup Ruby and Oracle Instant Client on Snow Leopard](http://blog.rayapps.com/2009/09/06/how-to-setup-ruby-and-oracle-instant-client-on-snow-leopard/). Note that you need to replace x86\_64 with i386 in the blog.

The Intel Instant client is for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. If you are using 10.4 Tiger,
use one of the following workarounds.

* compile ruby as ppc. (look at [How to setup Ruby and Oracle client on Intel Mac](http://blog.rayapps.com/2007/08/27/how-to-setup-ruby-and-oracle-client-on-intel-mac/))
* use [ruby-odbc](http://www.ch-werner.de/rubyodbc/) and a third party ODBC driver ([Actual Technologies](http://www.actualtechnologies.com) or [OpenLink Software](http://uda.openlinksw.com/)).
* use JRuby and Oracle JDBC driver.

PowerPC Mac
-----------

See [How to setup Ruby and Oracle Instant Client on Snow Leopard](http://blog.rayapps.com/2009/09/06/how-to-setup-ruby-and-oracle-instant-client-on-snow-leopard/). Note that you need to replace x86\_64 with ppc in the blog.

Solaris
=======

You need a same compiler which is used to make ruby itself.
For example, if the ruby is compiled by gcc, you need gcc. If it is compiled by Oracle Solaris Studio
(formerly called as Sun Studio), you need Oracle Solaris Studio.

If "require 'oci8'" raises "OCI Library Initialization Error", ruby-oci8 version is 2.1.4 or lower,
ruby version is 1.9.3 or upper, and ruby is compiled as an x86 32-bit executable by gcc, you may need
to add the following code to ext/oci8/oci8lib.c to export a symbol `main`.

    int main() { return 0; }

If you use Blastwave.org's ruby and want not to install Sun Studio,
you can edit rbconfig.rb by your self. [(look at here)](http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=12630)

If you use Sunfreeware.com's ruby and 

    $ ruby -r rbconfig -e "p Config::CONFIG['GNU_LD']"

prints "yes", you may need to edit rbconfig.rb distributed with the ruby
as follows:

    from: CONFIG["LDFLAGS"] = "-L.  -Wl,-E"
    to:   CONFIG["LDFLAGS"] = "-L. "

FreeBSD
=======

There are two ways.

* use ruby and instant client on linux emulator
* use oracle8-client port

linux emulator
--------------

I have not run ruby-oci8 on linux emulator, but I guess it will
run as follows. If it works, please tell me.

If FreeBSD has a cross-compiler which can generate linux binaries,
use it to compile ruby and ruby-oci8.

If FreeBSD doesn't have such a compiler, install a linux distribution
which FreeBSD can emulate to a PC machine, make ruby and ruby-oci8 in
the linux box and copy them to the FreeBSD box as follows.

On linux:

    # make ruby
    tar xvfz ruby-1.8.x.tar.gz
    cd ruby-1.8.x
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ruby-1.8.x --enable-pthread
    make
    make install
    # setup instant client
      ....
    # make ruby-oci8
    PATH=/usr/local/ruby-1.8.x/bin:$PATH
    tar xvfz ruby-oci8-1.0.x.tar.gz
    cd ruby-oci8-1.0.x
    make
    make install
    cd /usr/local/
    tar cvfz ruby-1.8.x-linux.tar.gz ruby-1.8.x
 
Copy ruby-1.8.x-linux.tar.gz to the FreeBSD box.
 
On freebsd:

    cd /compat/linux/usr/local
    tar xvfz ruby-1.8.x-linux.tar.gz

oracle8-client port
-------------------

I don't recommend this because of the following two reasons.

* The oracle8-client port is made from Oracle 8.1.7.1 static library for Linux. Oracle have not supported the connectivity between 8.1.7.1 and Oracle 10g.
* It is very unstable. When it fails to connect to an Oracle server, it is down by segmentation fault on FreeBSD 7.0 not only when using ruby-oci8, but also by a very simple test code written by C.

If you try to use oracle8-client port, compile and install as follows.

* install oracle8-client

    cd /usr/ports/databases/oracle8-client
    make
    make install

* set an environment variable ORACLE\_HOME

    export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/local/oracle8-client

The rest steps are described at {file:docs/install-full-client.md}.

note: You have no need to set LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH because 
Oracle libraries in oracle8-client port are static ones.

HP-UX
=====

You need a ruby which is linked with ''libpthread'' and ''libcl''.

Run `configure`.

    tar xvfz ruby-1.9.x.tar.gz
    cd ruby-1.9.x
    ./configure

Then open `Makefile` to add '-lpthread -lcl' to `LIBS` and run `make`
and `make install`.

    make
    make install

The rest steps are described at {file:docs/install-full-client.md}.

Windows
=======

On some machines using a slow disk, you may get the following error.

    Permission denied - conftest.exe

Edit mkmf.rb for a workaround.

    def try_run(src, opt="")
      if try_link0(src, opt)
        xsystem("./conftest")
      else
        nil
      end
    ensure
      # add the following one line.
      sleep 1 if /mswin32|cygwin|mingw32|bccwin32/ =~ RUBY_PLATFORM
      rm_f "conftest*"
    end
